# Insertion sort algorithm
An insertion sort algorithm in Python3 that sorts a array of X random values and shows the process in a graph.

# Required libraries
- numpy
- matplotlib

Installing libraries: 

```
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

# How to use
Run the `insertion_sort.py` in the terminal using:

```
python3 insertion_sort.py [number_of_values]
```
Where `[number_of_values]` is the range of the array that will be sorted. The array's values are random numbers from 0 to 1.

# Demonstration
Running the file with `50` values
```
python3 insertion_sort.py 50
```
First the initial array will be printed:

And then the graph will appear in the screen:

When the script end the array's sorting the final sorted array will be printed:
